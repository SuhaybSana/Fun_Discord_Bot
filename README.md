# About The Project
(name) is a Discord Bot developed with Discord.p. It has fun games and commands that will lighten up your server.

## Setup and Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Discord.py.

```bash
pip install discord.py
```
Ensure that the words.txt and Cogs folder is in the same directory as main.py

## Commands
Here is a list of commands the bot has built-in.

### Command Prefix
The command prefix is "." and can be changed with the `.prefix <prefix>` command.

### Word Scramble
The `.unscramble` command gives you a scrambled word to unscramble (good luck).

### Odds Generator
The `.odds <lowest number> <highest number>` lets you pick a number within the range you specified. If the number matches the number the bot chose you're in big trouble because you'll be muted for that many minutes.

## TODO
- [ ] Add a `.war` command (both the bot and player start off with a random number of soldiers from 25-40 and will battle against each other)
  - [ ] `.attack` command (random attack from 1 - 6)
  - [ ] `.catapult` (does 5 damage and is randomly given at the beginning of the game)
  - [ ] `.cavalry` (guaranteed +1 attack damage on every attack but sacrifices 10 soldiers)
  - [ ] `.pikeman` (+10 soldiers but -1 damage on every attack)
